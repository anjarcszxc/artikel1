Diabetics is definitely recommended to apply a healthy lifestyle and routine use of drugs to control their blood sugar levels. However, when blood sugar continues to rise (after being evaluated every 3 months with HbA1c blood test) even though it has been given the drug, the next treatment option usually is insulin injection.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
For those of you who are advised to inject insulin, know first what to do and who are challenged when using insulin this injection.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Various things to do and be challenged when injecting insulin</div>
<div>
Insulin injections will be done alone by diabetics at home. Usually doctors will teach and provide the first guidance related to what to do when having to inject itself insulin. However, there are many important things that are often forgotten when using insulin injections. In fact, the error when injecting insulin can be fatal to health, could be your blood sugar becomes very low or even high.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Therefore, there are some things to watch out for when using insulin injection, anything?</div>
<h3>
1. Store insulin in the right place</h3>
<div>
You can not keep your insulin shots anywhere. The reason, this drug requires the right temperature to avoid damage. Insulin can only last a month if stored at room temperature between 15-30 degrees Celsius. It will last longer if insulin is stored in the refrigerator.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Insulin that has not been open (still sealed) if stored in the refrigerator can survive until the expiration of insulin expired. However, when the insulin has been opened, although stored in the refrigerator, can only last for one month only. Place insulin in a tightly sealed box and then you can store it in a cool cabinet.</div>
<h3>
2. Injecting insulin can not be anywhere</h3>
<div>
You can not inject insulin into any part of your body. not the same as injections of other drugs that have to enter the blood vessels, insulin injections should be about your body fat tissue.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Therefore, insulin can be injected into several points of the body that has a thick layer of fat, such as, stomach, thighs, and arms. By entering into the fat layer, insulin will be more easily and quickly absorbed by the body.</div>
<h3>
3. Always inject the insulin in the same place</h3>
<div>
Make sure you stay consistent in injecting insulin to the body part. That is, if your morning insulin injections do in the thighs, then the next morning shot is also better on the thigh. Or injections of insulin for the night, you usually do on the stomach, then continue to do a special insulin injections at night in the stomach, do not move around. This in turn affects the absorption of insulin.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
However, if you will inject more insulin in the same place, give a distance of about one finger from the body part, so that the fat tissue does not become stiff.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
4. Make sure to give the right type of insulin at the right time</h3>
<div>
Insulin injections are usually given several types, according to the dose and time of administration. Long-acting insulin is usually used at night, because this type of insulin can keep blood sugar in a long time, which is more than 12 hours.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Meanwhile, during the day, you will be given a type of short-acting insulin that can maintain blood sugar levels up to 5-8 hours. Usually, this type of insulin will be given 30-60 minutes before eating.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Incorrect insulin administration in the wrong hours, can cause your blood sugar levels to become uncontrollable. For example, you are wrong injecting long-acting insulin precisely when the day before eating, this can cause blood sugar levels even down and risk of hypoglycemia. Conversely, a drastic increase in blood sugar (hyperglycemia), can also occur due to misuse of insulin.</div>
<h3>
5. Note also your food intake</h3>
<div>
Using insulin injections is one effort to keep your blood sugar well preserved. But that does not mean with insulin treatment means you can eat whatever you want freely. The diet should still be kept healthy and low in sugar.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
You can also use a type of non-sugar sweetener that is low in calories and contains chromium. Chromium is a mineral substance that can accelerate the insulin response to blood sugar so that blood sugar levels can be well controlled.</div>
