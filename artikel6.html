<div>
<div>
Did you know there are three main types of carbohydrates in the diet? These three types are:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Starch (also known as complex carbohydrates)</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Fiber</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
You must also have heard of terms such as natural sugars, sugar extracts, low calorie sweeteners, alcohol sugar, refined grains, enriched grains, complex carbohydrates, sweet foods, and whole grains.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
No wonder if you are confused to find out what and how many types of carbohydrates to be consumed.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In the nutrition label, the term "total carbohydrate" includes all three types of carbohydrates above. This is the amount you should pay attention to if you are on a carbo diet.</div>
<h3>
Starch</h3>
<div>
Foods rich in starch include:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Starchy vegetables, corn, beans, and potatoes</li>
<li>Dried beans, lentils and nuts such as pinto beans, red beans, black beans and split peas</li>
<li>Grains such as wheat, barley, and rice. Most wheat products are made from wheat flour, including pasta, bread and biscuits, but the types of food also vary with the addition of grains.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Wheat groups can be processed as whole grains or processed grains.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Wheat consists of three parts:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Bran</li>
<li>Seed</li>
<li>Endosperm</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Bran is a hard outer shell. This section contains the most fiber and most of the B vitamins and minerals.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The seed is the next layer and contains many nutrients, including essential fatty acids and vitamin E.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The endosperm is a tender part in the middle of a wheat seed containing starch. Whole wheat means all the wheat is in the food.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
If you eat whole wheat aliens whole wheat that contains bran, seeds, and endosperms, then you will get all the nutrients that are in the grain. If you eat processed grains containing only the endosperm or flour part, you will lose a lot of vitamins and minerals. Therefore, whole seeds contain the whole part of the seed and are much more nutritious than processed grains.</div>
<h3>
Sugar</h3>
<div>
Sugar is another type of carbohydrate. You also know of simple sugars or easily digestible carbohydrates.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
There are two main types of sugar, namely:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Natural sugar as contained in milk or fruits</li>
<li>Sugars are added in the process of processing, such as canned fruit with thick syrup or to make a cake.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
On the nutrition label, the total weight of the calculated sugar includes natural sugar and added sugar.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
There are many different sugar designations. Common examples are brown sugar, brown sugar, syrup, honey, beet sugar, cane sugar, sweeteners, powdered sugar, raw sugar, turbinado, maple syrup, high fructose corn syrup, agave syrup and cane syrup.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
You may also have seen sugar kitchen with its chemical name, sucrose. Fruit sugar is also known as fructose and milk sugar is called lactose. You can recognize other types of sugar in the label because the chemical names also end in "-osa", such as glucose (also called dextrose), fructose (also called levulose), and lactose and maltose.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
Fiber</h3>
<div>
Fiber comes from vegetable, so fiber does not exist in animal products such as milk, eggs, meat, poultry, and fish.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Fiber is an undigested plant or vegetable substance, including fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and legumes. When you consume fibrous foods, the fibers will pass through the intestines and are not digested.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
For the sake of a healthy body condition, adults should consume fiber 25-30 grams / day. The majority of people do not consume enough fiber in their diet. Therefore, increasing the amount of fiber into your food is a wise choice. Most people only get fiber intake of no more than half recommended.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Fiber or fiber contribute to maintaining digestive health, helping you to stay routine, and make you feel full after eating.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
As an added benefit, a high-fiber diet can lower cholesterol levels, and this has been suggested by some researchers as another benefit of consuming fiber.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Fiber sources include:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Peas and legumes such as black beans, red beans, pintos, peas (garbanzos), white beans, and lentils.</li>
<li>Fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (eg, apples, corn and beans) and edible berries (berries).</li>
<li>Grains such as:</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Wheat pasta</div>
<div>
Wheat cereal. Look for foods that contain 3 grams of fiber or more per portion, including those made from wheat, and wheat bran.</div>
<div>
Wheat bread. It is a good source of fiber, since one slice of bread contains at least 3 grams of fiber. Look for wheat-based bread, such as wheat flour. Currently, many grain products contain "extra fiber" with fiber added to it.</div>
<div>
Beans, try some kind of beans. Peanuts, walnuts and almonds are a good source of fiber and healthy fats, but keep in mind the portions, as they also contain lots of calories albeit in small quantities.</div>
<div>
In general, a perfect fiber source should contain at least 5 grams or more in each portion, though a good fiber source contains at least 2.5-4.9 grams per serving.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The best way to eat fiber is to eat fiber foods instead of taking supplements. In addition to fiber, this food is also rich in nutrients, contains many vitamins and minerals essential for the body. In fact, it is possible that the grains contain nutrients that are not even known!</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
It is important for you to know to increase fiber intake gradually in order to prevent stomach irritation. Remember always to increase your intake of water and other fluids to prevent constipation.</div>
