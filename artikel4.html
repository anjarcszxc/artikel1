<h3>
1. Eat green vegetables</h3>
<div>
Green and leafy vegetables are rich in vitamins that help you maintain a balanced diet and support a healthy immune system.</div>
<div>
According to an experiment conducted on mice, eating criciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, can help transmit chemical signals to the body that boost the protein on the cell surface needed to make the immune system work more optimally.</div>
<div>
In this study, healthy mice that did not eat green vegetables decreased surface cell pose by 70-80 percent.</div>
<h3>
2. Consumption of vitamin D</h3>
<div>
Vitamin D deficiency can cause symptoms such as poor bone growth, heart problems, and weakened immune systems.</div>
<div>
Foods that contain the best sources of vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, salmon, tuna, and beef liver. You can also buy vitamin D supplements and select ones containing D3 (cholecalciferol), as this is good at boosting levels of vitamin D in your blood.</div>
<div>
But before taking supplements, you should consult this to the doctor.</div>
<h3>
3. Regular exercise</h3>
<div>
Stay active by exercising regularly. You can start with a light sport like walking. Exercise regularly can make you fit and slim.</div>
<div>
In addition, a study proves that regular exercise can prevent inflammation and chronic diseases, reduce stress, and accelerate the circulation of white blood cells in the fight against disease.</div>
<h3>
4. Drinking green tea</h3>
<div>
Green tea has been linked to good health. The health benefits of green tea may be due to the high levels of antioxidants, called flavonoids. So it can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</div>
<div>
Therefore, because it is easy to do how to maintain a healthy body this one has been done.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
5. Enough sleep</div>
<div>
Adequate sleep is one of the keys of a strong immune system. A study showed that people who sleep at least eight hours every night for two weeks indicate that the body is more immune from virus attacks and bacterial germs. Meanwhile, people who are less than 6 hours each night will be 4 times more likely to experience flu because of the virus than people who sleep 7 hours or more.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
This is due to the cytokines that the body releases during its long sleep. Cytokines are a type of protein that helps the body fight infections by boosting the immune system.</div>
<h3>
6. Manage your stress</h3>
<div>
Stress has been shown to weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to disease.</div>
<div>
Cortisol helps fight inflammation and disease. The constant release of hormones in people with chronic stress may reduce the ability of these hormones.</div>
<div>
This can cause the body to become inflamed and susceptible to disease. So one way to maintain proper body health is to control stress. You can try to do yoga or meditation exercises to control or eliminate stress.</div>
<h3>
7. Socialize with the people around</h3>
<div>
Sense of loneliness is often associated as a trigger of some diseases, especially in people who are recovering from heart surgery.</div>
<div>
Research published in the American Psychological Association shows that social isolation can increase stress, which slows down the immune response and the ability to heal quickly.</div>
<h3>
8. Maintain cleanliness</h3>
<div>
How to maintain other health is to maintain personal hygiene and the surrounding circle. That way, you avoid the attacks of various diseases. Here are some ways to maintain good hygiene:</div>
<div>
Shower every day</div>
<div>
Wash your hands before eating or preparing food, and after eating.</div>
<div>
Wash your hands before entering contact lenses or doing any other activity that makes you in touch with your eyes or mouth.</div>
<div>
Wash your hands for 20 seconds and rub under your fingernails.</div>
<div>
Close your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.</div>
</div>
